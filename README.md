## üìñ About
This beginner-friendly project demonstrates:
- Why storing passwords in plain text (or with weak hashes) is insecure.
- How a simple brute-force script can guess weak passwords quickly.
- How secure password storage using bcrypt mitigates brute-force attacks.

You will build and test:
- `weak-login/` ‚Üí a deliberately insecure login system.
- `secure-login/` ‚Üí a corrected login system using bcrypt.
- `brute-force/` ‚Üí a Python script that attempts to brute-force the weak system.
- `report/` ‚Üí short write-up with findings and recommendations.
